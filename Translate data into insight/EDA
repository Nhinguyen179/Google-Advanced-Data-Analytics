1- Exploratory data analysis 
-EDA: investigating, organizing and analyzing datasets -> summarize main characteristics 
-6 EDA practices:  
• Discovering: familiarize with each column meaning 
• Structuring: Transform and organize raw data to be more easily visualized, explained 
and modelled. It’s important to avoid bias (grouping data that does not represent the 
whole population) 
• Cleaning: Remove errors that may distort data or make it less useful 
• Joining: augmenting or adjusting data by adding values from other datasets 
• Validating: verify that data is consistent and high quality 
• Presenting: make your cleaned dataset / data visualizations available to others for 
analysis or further modelling -> The process is iterative and non-sequential. A real example:
